See &lt;a href="https://alpscode.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-api/">the first part&lt;/a> to learn how to register an app to Reddit API and get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I often use PyCharm or Jupyter notebook for Python, but any Python environment will do the trick.
You need to have a Reddit app id and app secret already at hand for this part.
A basic knowledge of HTML and CSS might be useful, but not required for the high level content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to use Reddit API</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 23:28:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/how-to-use-reddit-api/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most valuable things I learned in recent years was learning how to use Public APIs to develop tools.
An API (Application program interface) is a set of tools to communicate with another service.

Once you get the hang of it, there is endless possibilities what you can do with it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
