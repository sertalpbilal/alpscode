From automation to feature-rich text editors, I see Linux as a must for any programmer.
Powerful and hackable Linux ecosystem and the huge community make finding solutions to common problems very trivial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to use Windows for a variety of reasons, you are not out of options when it comes to using Linux.
Over the years, I have tried a lot of different ways to enable Linux functionality on Windows, some are better than others but all of them have specific use cases.
Windows 10 started supporting Linux subsystem natively a while ago which is called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
WSL basically enables you to run Linux executables on Windows 10, natively.
In this blog post, I will show how you can enable the Linux subsystem support on Windows 10, install Ubuntu and do some customization without an arm and a leg.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
