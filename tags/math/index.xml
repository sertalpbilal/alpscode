Every GW, we&amp;rsquo;d look at our team and wish that we&amp;rsquo;d that shiny player everyone else had.
Sometimes Bruno, sometimes Gundogan, and sometimes Martinez.
Week after week we were filled with regret after not buying (or worse: benching) that player.
Of course with hindsight being 20/20, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see what you missed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if you could get the &lt;a target=_blank href="https://youtu.be/zorz3SXqjv0">&amp;lsquo;Almanac&amp;rsquo; just like in Back to the Future 2&lt;/a> and know how every week would play out?
You might think it could make your life easier, but that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely correct.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>O-Ring Optimization for FPL</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/o-ring-optimization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 11:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/o-ring-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The Numbers Game&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> is a great read for anyone interested in football (soccer) analytics.
The book covers a wide range of events where numbers give insights to football professionals on topics like possession, short/long passes, and team evaluation.
I have recently read the section about the &amp;ldquo;O-Ring theory&amp;rdquo;, which brought a couple of new ideas regarding FPL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>O-Ring theory&lt;/em> says that a team (or a system) is as strong as its weakest link.
The idea itself is coming from the Space Shuttle &lt;em>Challenger&lt;/em>, where the failure of O-ring seals caused the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster" target="_blank">catastrophic event in 1986&lt;/a>.
When applied to football, the theory points out that clubs should be improving (or replacing) their weakest players in the field, instead of focusing on superstars.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the meaning of optimal in FPL</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/optimal-in-fpl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/optimal-in-fpl/</guid><description>&lt;p>The amount of available content for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is unbelivable and hard to follow.
Among all, one of my favorite resources is the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/uncertainty_pod" target="_blank">Corridor of Uncertainty&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; podcast as they focus on modeling and analytics part of FPL.
Their guest in the latest episode was Abdul Rehman (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FPL_Salah" target="_blank">FPL Salah&lt;/a>), who is a well-known manager in the FPL community.
I truly enjoyed their discussion and noticed that the word &amp;ldquo;optimal&amp;rdquo; is thrown around quite a bit.
Since I do optimization for a living, it makes me happy to hear it in everyday conversations, especially regarding FPL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On FPL, Optimization, and Ownership Weights</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/fpl-ownership-weight/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 12:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/fpl-ownership-weight/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Cialdini mentions &lt;em>scarcity&lt;/em> as one of the 6 principles of persuasion.
The nature of seeking something of great interest is embedded inside all of us.
Our first reaction when we see other people do something is to follow them.
Even though it does not make too much sense, we follow the herd even in a competitive game, like Fantasy Premier League.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week&amp;rsquo;s (GW11) unfortunate gold rush to Jota proved that we fear being left out.
Of course the potential price changes further trigger and support our knee-jerk reactions, however it is important to separate what we want to do and &lt;strong>feel forced&lt;/strong> to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Plotting a piecewise function graph in LaTeX</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/piecewise-latex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 14:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/piecewise-latex/</guid><description>&lt;p>I absolutely adore LaTeX generated documents and personally use it pretty much for anything I can.
Plotting graphs is one of my favorite thing to do.
TikZ library makes it quite easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To plot a piecewise function, I happened to learn about &lt;code>\tikzmath&lt;/code> which I have never used before.
Using it, you can define values and also perform math operations.
I used this approach to set values and plot the graph dynamically.
This approach saved me quite some to fine tune the graph in the long run.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
