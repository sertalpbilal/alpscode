Plotting graphs is one of my favorite thing to do.
TikZ library makes it quite easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To plot a piecewise function, I happened to learn about &lt;code>\tikzmath&lt;/code> which I have never used before.
Using it, you can define values and also perform math operations.
I used this approach to set values and plot the graph dynamically.
This approach saved me quite some to fine tune the graph in the long run.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What to do for a better password security and management</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/what-to-do-for-password-security/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 21:22:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/what-to-do-for-password-security/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know that much about cyber, but I do think that&amp;rsquo;s the number one problem with mankind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We should be talking about password safety after &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/collection-one-breach-email-accounts-passwords/" title="Wired&amp;#39;s story on the issue" target="_blank">773 million records exposed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who complain when IT forces to change passwords at regular intervals.
It is a nightmare for me to come up with secure passwords and even when I can, I have a hard time remembering them.
So, believe me when I say that I know the struggle of dealing with passwords.
My colleagues are the same.
Last week one of my colleagues was saying that &amp;ldquo;Ah damn, I got that password change notification again&amp;rdquo;.
Passwords are unfortunately a burden we need to carry, an artifact of the technology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Linux on Windows</title><link>https://alpscode.com/blog/linux-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 14:30:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://alpscode.com/blog/linux-on-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>Linux is arguably the most developer-friendly operating system.
From automation to feature-rich text editors, I see Linux as a must for any programmer.
Powerful and hackable Linux ecosystem and the huge community make finding solutions to common problems very trivial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to use Windows for a variety of reasons, you are not out of options when it comes to using Linux.
Over the years, I have tried a lot of different ways to enable Linux functionality on Windows, some are better than others but all of them have specific use cases.
Windows 10 started supporting Linux subsystem natively a while ago which is called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
WSL basically enables you to run Linux executables on Windows 10, natively.
In this blog post, I will show how you can enable the Linux subsystem support on Windows 10, install Ubuntu and do some customization without an arm and a leg.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
